Problem we solved:
At least how many movies should we watch until we see a certain percentage
of actors and what are these movies?

How we solved it:
We first picked the movie with the most actors and add the actors that
starred in said movie to a disjoint set and calculate how many actors are
in this set and divide that by total number of actors to get the percentage.
We keep going until our set is at least as large as the specified percentage.

How we tested it:
  We ran the file, calculated the size of our actor set and made sure it
met our percentage requirement.

How to run:
Our extension takes 3 command line arguments:
  1) movie_casts.tsv
  2) output file
  3) a number between 1 and 100 which represents the percentage of actors
     you want to see.

For example:
./extension movie_casts.tsv a.out 30
